## Objective

To develop a WebApp which users can utilize to search for Friends to visit the gym with. Users should be able to fitler search results to find a Friend that best suits them.

---

## Usage
To install this program, please copy the SSH key from the repository to clone it to your machine. Once cloned, the user must create a 'fit_db' or update the schema accordingly. Next, they should then use the command terminal and enter 'node seeds/seed.js' to seed their database. 

Once seeded, 'node index.js', will initiate the server on localhost. A user can then visit the landing page where they'll be prompted to either log in or sign up. After doing so they will be directed to their user profile, where they can open a chat window to contact other Fridends or upate their account information.

Using the navbar, users can then navigate to the results page by selecting "Matches", here users will be shown all available Friends within the database. Users may then scroll through the available Friends until they find one they wish to connect with, in which they can then view their full profile by selecting the image of the specified Friend.
